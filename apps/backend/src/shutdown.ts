/**
 * Builds a signal handler that performs an idempotent graceful shutdown:
 *
 * 1. `server.close()` immediately stops accepting *new* connections but lets
 *    in-flight HTTP requests finish — its callback fires only once every
 *    connection has closed. Run concurrently with (2) rather than before it,
 *    since neither depends on the other and both should start draining as
 *    soon as the signal is received.
 * 2. The polling worker, retry worker, and DLQ eviction task are stopped.
 *    The polling worker's stop() drains (awaits any in-flight poll); the
 *    other two are plain interval stops with nothing to drain.
 * 3. Once both of the above have settled, the queue store and circuit
 *    breaker store are closed — after, not concurrently with, anything that
 *    might still write through them.
 *
 * A watchdog timer force-exits with code 1 if the whole sequence takes
 * longer than `shutdownTimeoutMs`, so a connection that never closes (e.g. a
 * client holding a keep-alive socket open) cannot hang the process forever.
 *
 * Calling the returned handler more than once is a no-op after the first
 * call — a process can receive both SIGTERM and SIGINT in close succession.
