/**
 * Request logging middleware (#1722).
 *
 * Logs one INFO-level line per request (method, path, status, duration) with
 * no request body at all — safe at any log level, in any environment.
 *
 * A second, DEBUG-only line additionally includes the request body, but only
 * after redacting fields considered sensitive (see SENSITIVE_FIELDS below).
 * Because `logger.ts` only emits DEBUG output when LOG_LEVEL=debug (or
 * NODE_ENV is not production), this line — redacted or not — never reaches
 * production logs under the default configuration. The redaction happens
 * regardless, as defense in depth against LOG_LEVEL being explicitly set to
 * debug in production.
 *
 * Sensitive fields and why:
 * - `player1`, `player2`, `address`, `walletAddress`, `stellarAddress` —
 *   Stellar wallet addresses. Pseudonymous but linkable to a specific person
 *   via on-chain activity, and treated as personal data under some
 *   jurisdictions' privacy laws (e.g. GDPR's "pseudonymous data").
 * - `username` — the player's chess-platform handle (Lichess/Chess.com),
 *   which is frequently the player's real name or links to a public profile.
 * - `password`, `secret`, `apiKey`, `privateKey` — credentials. Never
 *   belong in logs at any level, redacted here as defense in depth even
 *   though none of this backend's current routes accept them in a body.
