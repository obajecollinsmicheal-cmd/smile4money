//! # Leaderboard Contract
//!
//! Tracks lifetime win / loss / draw records and total earnings per Stellar
//! address, so a frontend can render a ranked leaderboard without replaying
//! the escrow's entire history off-chain.
//!
//! ## How results get in
//!
//! The escrow contract emits an event when a match completes. The leaderboard
//! cannot subscribe to events â€” Soroban contracts cannot observe other
//! contracts' events â€” so a **trusted relayer** (the existing oracle service)
//! reads the payout event and calls
//! [`record_result`](LeaderboardContract::record_result).
//!
//! The relayer is registered as a data source at
//! [`initialize`](LeaderboardContract::initialize) or later via
//! [`add_source`](LeaderboardContract::add_source). This is deliberately *not*
//! "anyone can submit": a leaderboard that any caller could write to is not a
//! leaderboard, it is a graffiti wall. Forgetting a result is recoverable
//! (replay it); corrupting one is not.
//!
//! ## Why the relayer is the trust boundary
//!
//! The leaderboard is a **display** contract. It escrows nothing and moves no
//! funds, so a dishonest relayer can only produce a wrong ranking â€” it cannot
//! steal anything. That keeps the consequence of compromising this contract
//! small, which is the right trade for a feature whose only job is a leaderboard
//! page. Payout correctness is unaffected: it lives in the escrow contract and
//! is already final by the time this contract hears about it.
//!
//! ## Identity and edge cases
//!
//! A player is identified by the address that actually escrowed, which is the
//! Stellar address, not a platform username. Usernames are reassignable on both
//! Lichess and Chess.com; tying a permanent record to one would let a new
//! account inherit an old player's history.
//!
//! Every recorded result must name **two distinct** players. A result where both
//! sides are the same address is rejected rather than counted, because it would
//! hand a player a free win and a loss simultaneously and inflate
//! `matches_played`.
