# ADR-003: Single-Elimination Tournament Bracket Contract

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Issue:** #1802 / #123 (v2.0 roadmap — multi-game tournament support)
- **Supersedes:** nothing
- **Related:** ADR-001 (dispute window), ADR-002-immutable-safe-address

## Context

`EscrowContract` models exactly one 1v1 chess match. The v2.0 roadmap calls for
multi-player competitions, which raises a question the escrow contract was never
asked to answer: who holds the money when there are more than two players, and
who decides that a match is over?

The existing pieces do not compose on their own:

- `EscrowContract::create_match` takes exactly two players, and
  `finalize_result` pays `stake_amount × 2` to the winner. Chaining N escrow
  matches does not produce a tournament — it produces N independent 1v1 bets
  with N separate pots.
- `OracleContract::submit_result` is keyed by a `u64` match ID and reports a
  `MatchResult` of `Player1Wins` / `Player2Wins` / `Draw`. A draw has no meaning
  in a single-elimination bracket, and `Player1Wins` is meaningless without a
  `Match` record to resolve it against.

A tournament needs its own contract that owns the entry fees, owns the bracket
structure, and turns an oracle result into "this player is in the next round".

## Decision

Add a new `smile4money-tournament-bracket` Soroban contract implementing a
**single-elimination bracket for a power-of-two field**.

### 1. The bracket is data in one contract, not a tree of deployed contracts

**Decision:** the tree of matches lives in this contract's storage as
`MatchNode` records. A tournament of N players creates N−1 `MatchNode` records.
No per-match contract is deployed.

The roadmap language is "creates a tree of match contracts". Deploying one
contract per match was considered and rejected:

| | One node contract per match | Nodes in one contract (**chosen**) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment cost | N−1 deployments, each with its own WASM instance | one deployment |
| Prize pool | N separate pots that must be reconciled off-chain and on-chain | one balance, one invariant |
| Round advancement | requires N−1 cross-contract calls per round | one storage write |
| Advancement atomicity | a partial round leaves a half-advanced tree | one transaction, all-or-nothing |
| Audit surface | N× the contract interface | one interface |

A "tree of match contracts" also cannot work with the existing `EscrowContract`
unchanged: its 1v1 shape has nowhere to put a third player, and its
`finalize_result` pays out per match, which — see §3 — is the wrong shape for a
prize pool.

**Rejected alternative: reuse `EscrowContract` N times.** Preserves deployment
cost and the audit surface, but loses the atomicity of a round and forces the
prize pool to be tracked outside the contracts entirely. The prize pool is the
one thing that most needs to be an on-chain invariant.

### 2. Bracket shape and seeding

- `player_count` must be a power of two, `2 ≤ player_count ≤ 64` (6 rounds).
  No byes, so no seed is ever idle.
- `rounds = log2(player_count)`; round 0 is the first round, round `rounds - 1`
  is the final. Round `r` has `player_count >> (r + 1)` nodes.
- Node `i` of round `r` feeds node `i / 2` of round `r + 1`, into `player1`
  when `i` is even and `player2` when `i` is odd.
- Entrants are seeded **snake-style** in the order they are supplied: seed 1
  plays seed N, seed 2 plays seed N−1, and so on. The strongest and weakest
  seeds are kept apart for as long as possible, and the top two seeds can only
  meet in the final. For a 4-player bracket, `[s0 s3] [s1 s2]`.

### 3. Prize accounting: entry fee once, whole pot to the champion

**Decision:** each entrant pays `entry_fee` exactly once, at
[`deposit`]. No per-match payouts happen during the tournament. When the final
is decided, the champion receives the entire pot,
`entry_fee × player_count`.

This is the part that most needs to be stated explicitly, because the obvious
alternative is wrong:

> If each match paid its winner `2 × entry_fee` as it does in `EscrowContract`,
> round 1 of a 4-player tournament would pay out 2 matches × 2 × fee = 4 × fee,
> which is the *entire* pot. The pot would be empty before the final.

An earlier-round winner is paid nothing and simply advances; their fee stays in
the pot and is only realised if they go on to win the whole thing. This makes
the invariant a one-liner:

```
sum(entry fees held) == entry_fee × funded_count   at all times
contract token balance - escrow_reserve == entry_fee × funded_count   once funded
```

after the final: `contract balance - reserve == 0` and the champion's balance
rises by `entry_fee × player_count`.

### 4. Winners advance on oracle result submission

**Decision:** the trusted oracle reports the result of a single node via
[`submit_match_result`]. Advancement happens inside that call, so a winner is
advanced by the same transaction that records the result.

- Only the registered oracle may call it.
- The reported `winner` must be one of the node's two `Address`es. A `Draw` is
  not representable: there is no `MatchResult` parameter, the oracle names the
  advancing `Address`, and a name that is not one of the two players is
  rejected. This is strictly safer than reusing `MatchResult`, which is
  positional (`Player1Wins`) and therefore only meaningful alongside a `Match`.
- If the node is not in the final, its winner is written into the parent node
  and the parent becomes `AwaitingResult` once both its slots are filled.
- If the node *is* the final, the tournament becomes `Completed` and the pot is
  transferred to the champion in the same call.

No dispute window is added here. A tournament node is not a match between two
parties with money at risk in the way an escrow match is — nothing is released
until the final, and an early result only advances a player who has already paid
their fee. Correcting an early result is a matter of re-running the oracle with
an authoritative bracket. **This is a deliberate simplification and the most
likely thing to revisit**: if early-round results do need to be disputable, the
node needs a `pending_winner` and a `DISPUTE_WINDOW_LEDGERS` delay exactly as
ADR-001 specifies for `EscrowContract`.

### 5. Nobody can lock the pot

A tournament that stalls must not be able to hold player money indefinitely. Two
exit paths, both refunding every funded entrant in full:

- [`cancel_tournament`] — admin, while the tournament is still `Registration`
  (i.e. no match has been decided). Cheap and immediate.
- [`claim_timeout`] — callable by **anyone** once `TIMEOUT_LEDGERS` have elapsed
  since the tournament was created. This is the trustless backstop, and mirrors
  `EscrowContract::claim_timeout`, which is likewise permissionless.

**Known limitation:** a tournament that is decided-but-not-final is resolved by
refunding everyone, not by advancing a default winner. Deciding who advances when
a player refuses to play (rematch deadline, walkover, seeding penalty) is real
policy and is deliberately out of scope here. Until it exists, a stalled
tournament resolves in favour of *everyone getting their money back*, which is
the safe direction to be wrong in.

## Consequences

### Positive

- One place to reason about the whole tournament, so the pot is a checkable
  on-chain invariant rather than an off-chain reconciliation.
- A round advances atomically, so the tree is never half-advanced.
- Reuses the repo's existing vocabulary: same TTL constants
  (`MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS`, `TIMEOUT_LEDGERS`, `ESCROW_RESERVE_BUFFER_STROOPS` from
  `smile4money_common::constants`), same `game_id` validation, same
  immutable-`safe_address` posture as
  [ADR-002-immutable-safe-address](002-immutable-safe-address.md), same
  `is_zero_address` and `ensure_reserve_for_payout` guards as the escrow.
- Power-of-two only means no byes and therefore no "ghost match" nodes, which is
  the usual source of off-by-one bugs in bracket code.

### Negative

- `MAX_PLAYERS = 64` bounds a tournament. Larger fields need a different shape.
- No dispute window on intermediate results (§4).
- No double elimination, no seeding overrides, no consolation brackets. The
  bracket is a fixed complete binary tree; anything else needs a different
  progression rule.
- Fee is `entry_fee × player_count` held in **this** contract's token balance,
  so a single large tournament consumes one account's balance. The reserve guard
  accounts for that, but it does mean the pot is not sharded.

### Neutral

- The oracle contract is **not** modified. The bracket reads the same off-chain
  game results the oracle already polls, but calls into the bracket directly
  with the advancing `Address`. Wiring the existing `OracleContract` to fan out
  to brackets is a separate change, so this contract is deployable and testable
  now.

## Test strategy

`contracts/tournament-bracket/src/tests.rs` covers:

- **Full 4-player progression** (the acceptance criterion): all four entrants
  fund, the two semifinals are decided, the winners land in the final node, the
  final is decided, and the champion is paid `entry_fee × 4` with the pot
  drained to the reserve.
- Structural invariants: N players always produce N−1 nodes; seeding pairs
  `[s0 s3] [s1 s2]`; `2^k` players produce k rounds.
- Rejections: non-power-of-two field, duplicate entrants, zero addresses,
  outsider funding, double funding, a result for a node that is not yet
  `AwaitingResult`, a winner who is not one of the two players, a non-oracle
  caller, a re-submitted result.
- Cancellation: admin cancel refunds every funded entrant; `claim_timeout`
  before the deadline is rejected and refunds everyone after it.
