# API Reference

Complete reference for all smart contract functions, types, and errors.

## Escrow Contract

### Initialization

#### `initialize`

Initialize the escrow contract with oracle, admin, and default token addresses.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, oracle: Address, admin: Address, token: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `oracle`: Address of the trusted oracle that may call `submit_result`
- `admin`: Address of the contract administrator (pause/unpause, oracle rotation)
- `token`: Address of the default SEP-41 token contract used for staking

**Behavior:**
- Validates `token` by calling a read-only method on it; panics if not a valid token contract
- Sets the oracle, admin, and token addresses in instance storage
- Initializes match counter to `0`
- Sets paused state to `false`
- Panics if already initialized

**Authorization:** None required (callable once only)

**Errors:**
- Panics with `"Contract already initialized"` if called a second time

---

### Admin Functions

#### `pause`

Pause the contract to prevent new matches, deposits, and result submissions.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn pause(env: Env) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Behavior:**
- Sets paused flag to `true`
- Blocks `create_match`, `deposit`, and `submit_result`
- `cancel_match` remains available so players can recover funds
- Emits `("admin", "paused")` event

**Authorization:** Requires admin signature

**Errors:**
- `Error::Unauthorized`: Caller is not the admin

---

#### `unpause`

Resume normal contract operations.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn unpause(env: Env) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Behavior:**
- Sets paused flag to `false`
- Re-enables all contract functions
- Emits `("admin", "unpaused")` event

**Authorization:** Requires admin signature

**Errors:**
- `Error::Unauthorized`: Caller is not the admin

---

#### `update_oracle`

Rotate the trusted oracle address.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn update_oracle(env: Env, new_oracle: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `new_oracle`: Replacement oracle address

**Behavior:**
- Replaces the stored oracle address with `new_oracle`
- Emits `("admin", "oracle")` event with the new oracle address

**Authorization:** Requires admin signature

**Example:**
```rust
escrow.update_oracle(&new_oracle_addr);
```

---

### Match Management

#### `create_match`

- Validates `game_id` length is between 1 and 64 bytes
- Rejects duplicate `game_id` values
- Creates match in `Pending` state
- Increments match counter with overflow check
- Extends TTL to `MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS` (~30 days)
- Emits `("match", "created")` event

**Authorization:** Requires `player1` signature

**Errors:**
- `Error::ContractPaused`: Contract is paused
- `Error::InvalidAmount`: `stake_amount ≤ 0`
- `Error::InvalidPlayers`: `player1 == player2`
- `Error::InvalidGameId`: `game_id` is empty or exceeds 64 bytes

- `Error::AlreadyExists`: Match ID collision (internal counter error)
- `Error::Overflow`: Match counter would exceed `u64::MAX`

**Example:**
```rust
let match_id = escrow.create_match(
    &player1_addr,
    &player2_addr,
    &1_000_0000, // 100 XLM (7 decimals)
    &xlm_token_addr,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess_abc123"),
    &Platform::Lichess,
);
```

---

#### `deposit`

```

**Parameters:**
- `match_id`: ID of the match to deposit into
- `player`: Address making the deposit (must be `player1` or `player2`)

**Behavior:**
- Validates match exists and is in `Pending` state
- Validates caller is `player1` or `player2`
- Transfers `stake_amount` tokens from `player` to the contract
- Marks the player as deposited
- If both players have deposited, transitions match to `Active` state and emits `("match", "activated")`
- Extends TTL to `MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS`
- Emits `("match", "deposit")` event

**Authorization:** Requires `player` signature

**Errors:**
- `Error::ContractPaused`: Contract is paused

// Player 2 deposits — match transitions to Active
escrow.deposit(&match_id, &player2_addr);
```

---

#### `cancel_match`

Cancel a pending match and refund any deposits.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn cancel_match(env: Env, match_id: u64, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `match_id`: ID of the match to cancel
- `caller`: Address requesting cancellation (must be `player1` or `player2`)

**Behavior:**
- Validates match is in `Pending` state (cancellation is not allowed once `Active`)

- Refunds `player1` if they deposited
- Refunds `player2` if they deposited
- Transitions to `Cancelled` state
- Extends TTL to `MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS`
- Emits `("match", "cancelled")` event
- Allowed even when the contract is paused (so players can always recover funds)

**Authorization:** Requires `caller` signature; if both players have deposited, requires both `player1` and `player2` signatures

**Errors:**
- `Error::MatchNotFound`: Invalid `match_id`
- `Error::InvalidState`: Match is not `Pending` (already `Active`, `Completed`, or `Cancelled`)
- `Error::Unauthorized`: Caller is not `player1` or `player2`

---

### Result Submission

#### `submit_result`

Submit a verified match result and execute payout.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn submit_result(
    env: Env,

- `caller`: Address submitting the result (must be the registered oracle)

**Behavior:**
- Validates `caller` is the trusted oracle address
- Validates `game_id` matches the match's stored `game_id` (prevents cross-match result injection)
- Validates match is in `Active` state
- Validates both players have deposited
- Executes payout based on `winner`:
  - `Player1`: Transfers `stake_amount × 2` to `player1`
  - `Player2`: Transfers `stake_amount × 2` to `player2`
  - `Draw`: Returns `stake_amount` to each player
- Transitions to `Completed` state

### Query Functions

#### `get_match`

Retrieve full match details.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn get_match(env: Env, match_id: u64) -> Result<Match, Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `match_id`: ID of the match to query

**Returns:**
- `Match`: Complete match struct

**Errors:**
- `Error::MatchNotFound`: Invalid `match_id`

**Example:**
```rust
let match_data = escrow.get_match(&match_id);
assert_eq!(match_data.state, MatchState::Active);
```

---

#### `is_funded`

Check if both players have deposited.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn is_funded(env: Env, match_id: u64) -> Result<bool, Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `match_id`: ID of the match to check

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `true` if both players have deposited, `false` otherwise

**Errors:**
- `Error::MatchNotFound`: Invalid `match_id`

**Example:**
```rust
if escrow.is_funded(&match_id) {
    // Match is ready to start
}
```

---

#### `get_escrow_balance`

Get total tokens held in escrow for a match.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn get_escrow_balance(env: Env, match_id: u64) -> Result<i128, Error>
```

**Parameters:**
- `match_id`: ID of the match to check

**Returns:**
- `i128`: Total escrowed amount (`0`, `stake_amount`, or `2 × stake_amount`)

**Behavior:**
- Returns `0` if match is `Completed` or `Cancelled`
- Returns `stake_amount` if exactly one player has deposited
- Returns `2 × stake_amount` if both players have deposited

**Errors:**
- `Error::MatchNotFound`: Invalid `match_id`

**Example:**
```rust
let balance = escrow.get_escrow_balance(&match_id);
// 0, stake_amount, or 2 * stake_amount
```

---

#### `list_matches`

Retrieve a paginated list of match IDs.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn list_matches(env: Env, start: u64, limit: u32) -> Vec<u64>
```

**Parameters:**
- `start`: Match ID to start from (inclusive)
- `limit`: Maximum number of match IDs to return (capped at 100)

**Returns:**
- `Vec<u64>`: Vector of match IDs from `start` up to the next 100 entries (or fewer)

**Behavior:**
- Returns match IDs in range `[start, start + limit)` where the limit is automatically capped at **100**
- If `start >= total_match_count`, returns an empty vector (last page)
- If fewer matches exist between `start` and `start + limit`, only returns available IDs
- Empty return indicates the last page has been reached

**Pagination Example:**
```rust
let mut start = 0;
loop {
    let matches = escrow.list_matches(&start, &100);
    if matches.is_empty() {
        break; // Reached the last page
    }
    
    // Process matches...
    for match_id in &matches {
        let match_data = escrow.get_match(match_id);
        println!("Match {}: {:?}", match_id, match_data.state);
    }
    
    // Advance to next page
    start = start + matches.len() as u64;
}
```

**Notes:**
- Requesting a `limit` greater than 100 does not error; it is silently capped at 100
- To detect the last page: if the returned vector has fewer entries than requested, you have reached the end
- All match IDs are returned sequentially (0, 1, 2, ...) regardless of state

---

#### `list_matches_after`

Retrieve a paginated list of match IDs using **cursor-based** (keyset) pagination, a more robust alternative to `list_matches`.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn list_matches_after(env: Env, after_match_id: u64, limit: u32) -> Vec<u64>
```

**Parameters:**
- `after_match_id`: Return IDs strictly greater than this value. Use `u64::MAX` to start from the beginning.
- `limit`: Maximum number of match IDs to return (capped at 100)

**Returns:**
- `Vec<u64>`: Vector of match IDs greater than `after_match_id`, up to `limit` entries

**Behavior:**
- Returns IDs in the range `(after_match_id, after_match_id + limit]` (capped at 100 iterations)
- **Unambiguous end-of-data**: an empty result always means there are no further matches. Unlike offset-based `list_matches`, a sparse ID space cannot produce a false "gap"
- Cursor reuse is safe: the same cursor remains valid even if the contract state changes between calls
- If fewer matches exist after the cursor, only the available IDs are returned

**Pagination Example:**
```rust
let mut cursor = u64::MAX; // start before all IDs
loop {
    let matches = escrow.list_matches_after(&cursor, &100);
    if matches.is_empty() {
        break; // Reached the end of data
    }

    // Process matches...
    for match_id in &matches {
        let match_data = escrow.get_match(match_id);
        println!("Match {}: {:?}", match_id, match_data.state);
    }

    // Advance the cursor using the last returned ID
    cursor = matches.get(matches.len() - 1);
}
```

**Notes:**
- Prefer this function over `list_matches` when iterating matches in sparse ID spaces (e.g. many cancelled matches), since it never misses entries
- Requesting a `limit` greater than 100 does not error; it is silently capped at 100
- To detect the last page: an empty vector indicates the end of data

---

#### `list_results`

Retrieve a paginated list of oracle results.

**Signature:**
```rust
pub fn list_results(env: Env, start: u64, limit: u32) -> Vec<(u64, ResultEntry)>
```

**Parameters:**
- `start`: Match ID to start searching from (inclusive)
- `limit`: Maximum number of results to return (capped at 100)

**Returns:**
- `Vec<(u64, ResultEntry)>`: Vector of tuples containing `(match_id, result_entry)` for matches with submitted results

**Behavior:**
- Scans match IDs starting from `start` up to `start + limit` (capped at 100 iterations)
- Only returns entries where a result has been submitted via `submit_result`
- If no results exist in the scanned range, returns an empty vector
- Unlike `list_matches`, the returned vector may be **shorter than the limit** because skipped IDs (those without results) are not included

**Pagination Example:**
```rust
let mut start = 0;
let mut all_results = Vec::new();
loop {
    let results = oracle.list_results(&start, &100);
    if results.is_empty() {
        break; // No results found in this range, stop scanning
    }
    
    // Process results...
    for (match_id, entry) in &results {
        println!("Match {}: {} -> {:?}", match_id, entry.game_id, entry.result);
    }
    
    // Advance scan position by 100 (not by results.len(), since results can be sparse)
    start = start + 100;
}
```

**Important Differences from list_matches:**
- `list_results` scans up to 100 match IDs but returns only those with submitted results
- A page may return fewer entries than the cap (empty matches are skipped)
- To iterate through all results without gaps, always advance `start` by 100, not by `results.len()`
- Requesting a `limit` greater than 100 does not error; it is silently capped at 100

## Usage Examples

### Complete Match Flow

```rust
// 1. Initialize contracts
escrow.initialize(&oracle_addr, &admin_addr, &xlm_token_addr);
oracle.initialize(&oracle_service_addr);

// 2. Create match
let match_id = escrow.create_match(
    &player1,
    &player2,
    &100_0000000, // 100 XLM (7 decimals)
    &xlm_token,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess_game123"),
    &Platform::Lichess,
);

// 3. Players deposit
escrow.deposit(&match_id, &player1);
escrow.deposit(&match_id, &player2); // match transitions to Active

// 4. Verify match is funded
assert!(escrow.is_funded(&match_id));

// 5. Players play the chess game...

// 6. Oracle records result on-chain
oracle.submit_result(
    &match_id,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess_game123"),
    &MatchResult::Player1Wins,
);

// 7. Oracle triggers payout on escrow
escrow.submit_result(
    &match_id,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess_game123"),
    &Winner::Player1,
    &oracle_addr,
);

// 8. Verify completion
let match_data = escrow.get_match(&match_id);
assert_eq!(match_data.state, MatchState::Completed);
```

### Cancellation Flow

```rust
// Create match
let match_id = escrow.create_match(...);

// Player1 deposits
escrow.deposit(&match_id, &player1);

// Player2 decides not to play — cancels and player1 is refunded
escrow.cancel_match(&match_id, &player2);
```

### Emergency Pause

```rust
// Admin pauses contract
escrow.pause();

// All mutating operations are blocked
assert!(escrow.try_create_match(...).is_err()); // Error::ContractPaused

// cancel_match still works so players can recover funds
escrow.cancel_match(&match_id, &player1);

// Admin unpauses
escrow.unpause();

// Operations resume normally
```

### Oracle Admin Rotation

```rust
// Transfer oracle admin to a new key
oracle.transfer_admin(&new_oracle_service_addr);

// Old admin can no longer submit results
// New admin can submit results immediately
oracle.submit_result(&match_id, &game_id, &MatchResult::Draw);
```
