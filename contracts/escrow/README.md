## Overview

```
Player1 + Player2 agree on a stake
        │
        ▼
   create_match()  ──► Pending
        │
   deposit() x2   ──► Active
        │
  submit_result() ──► Completed  (winner gets 2× stake, or draw refunds both)
        │
   cancel_match() ──► Cancelled  (refunds any deposits already made)
```

The contract is initialized once with an **admin** and an **oracle** address. The admin controls administrative operations (pause/unpause, oracle rotation). The oracle is the only address authorized to submit match results.

---

## Types

### MatchState

```rust
pub enum MatchState {
    Pending,    // Created, awaiting both deposits
    Active,     // Both players deposited; game in progress
    Completed,  // Result submitted; payout executed
    Cancelled,  // Cancelled before activation
}
```

### Platform

```rust
pub enum Platform {
    Lichess,
    ChessDotCom,
}
```

Identifies the chess platform where the game is played.

### Winner

```rust
pub enum Winner {
    Player1,  // Player1 wins; receives 2× stake
    Player2,  // Player2 wins; receives 2× stake
    Draw,     // Both players refunded their stake
}
```

### Match

```rust
pub struct Match {
    pub id: u64,
    pub player1: Address,
    pub player2: Address,
    pub stake_amount: i128,
    pub token: Address,
    pub game_id: String,
    pub platform: Platform,
    pub state: MatchState,
    pub player1_deposited: bool,
    pub player2_deposited: bool,
    pub created_ledger: u32,  // Ledger sequence at creation
}
```

---

## Public Functions

### `initialize`

Initializes the contract. Must be called exactly once before any other function.

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, oracle: Address, admin: Address)
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `oracle` | `Address` | The trusted oracle address authorized to submit match results |
| `admin` | `Address` | The admin address authorized to pause/unpause and rotate the oracle |

**Panics**

- `"Contract already initialized"` — if called more than once.

**Example**

```rust
client.initialize(&oracle_address, &admin_address);
```

---

### `update_oracle`

Rotates the trusted oracle address. Only the admin can call this.

```rust
pub fn update_oracle(env: Env, new_oracle: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `new_oracle` | `Address` | The new oracle address to set |

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin |

**Events**

Emits `("admin", "oracle")` with the new oracle address as data.

**Example**

```rust
// Must be called by admin
client.update_oracle(&new_oracle_address);
```

---

### `pause`

Pauses the contract. Blocks `create_match`, `deposit`, and `submit_result`. Only the admin can call this.

```rust
pub fn pause(env: Env) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin |

**Events**

Emits `("admin", "paused")` with no data.

**Example**

```rust
client.pause(); // called by admin
```

---

### `unpause`

Unpauses the contract, re-enabling all operations. Only the admin can call this.

```rust
pub fn unpause(env: Env) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin |

**Events**

Emits `("admin", "unpaused")` with no data.

**Example**

```rust
client.unpause(); // called by admin
```

---

### `create_match`

Creates a new match and puts it in `Pending` state. `player1` must authorize this call. Both players must subsequently call `deposit` before the match becomes `Active`.

```rust
pub fn create_match(
    env: Env,
    player1: Address,
    player2: Address,
    stake_amount: i128,
    token: Address,
    game_id: String,
    platform: Platform,
) -> Result<u64, Error>
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `player1` | `Address` | First player; must authorize this call |
| `player2` | `Address` | Second player |
| `stake_amount` | `i128` | Amount each player must deposit (must be > 0) |
| `token` | `Address` | The Stellar asset contract address used for staking |
| `game_id` | `String` | Unique identifier for the chess game (max 64 bytes) |
| `platform` | `Platform` | Chess platform (`Lichess` or `ChessDotCom`) |

**Returns** `Ok(u64)` — the new match ID (auto-incremented from 0).

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `ContractPaused` | Contract is currently paused |
| `InvalidAmount` | `stake_amount` is ≤ 0 |
| `InvalidPlayers` | `player1 == player2` |
| `InvalidGameId` | `game_id` length exceeds 64 bytes |
| `DuplicateGameId` | A match with this `game_id` already exists |
| `AlreadyExists` | Internal: match ID collision (should not occur in practice) |
| `Overflow` | Internal match counter overflow |

**Events**

Emits `("match", "created")` with data `(match_id, player1, player2, stake_amount)`.

**Storage**

Match data is stored with a TTL of ~30 days (518,400 ledgers at 5s/ledger). The `game_id` is also stored to prevent reuse.

**Example**

```rust
let match_id = client.create_match(
    &player1,
    &player2,
    &100_0000000i128,       // 100 tokens (7 decimal places)
    &token_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess-game-abc123"),
    &Platform::Lichess,
);
```

---

### `deposit`

Deposits a player's stake into escrow. Each player calls this once. When both players have deposited, the match transitions from `Pending` to `Active`.

```rust
pub fn deposit(env: Env, match_id: u64, player: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `match_id` | `u64` | The ID of the match to deposit into |
| `player` | `Address` | The depositing player; must authorize this call |

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `ContractPaused` | Contract is currently paused |
| `MatchNotFound` | No match exists for `match_id` |
| `InvalidState` | Match is not in `Pending` state |
| `Unauthorized` | `player` is neither `player1` nor `player2` |
| `AlreadyFunded` | This player has already deposited |

**Events**

- Emits `("match", "deposit")` with data `(match_id, player)` on each deposit.
- Emits `("match", "activated")` with data `match_id` when both players have deposited.

**Token Transfer**

Transfers `stake_amount` tokens from `player` to the contract address using the token's `transfer` function. The player must have approved the contract to spend at least `stake_amount`.

**Example**

```rust
// Player1 deposits
client.deposit(&match_id, &player1);

// Player2 deposits — match becomes Active
client.deposit(&match_id, &player2);
```

---

### `submit_result`

Called by the oracle to submit the verified match result and trigger payout. The `game_id` parameter must match the one stored in the match to prevent cross-match result injection.

```rust
pub fn submit_result(
    env: Env,
    match_id: u64,
    game_id: String,
    winner: Winner,
    caller: Address,
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `match_id` | `u64` | The ID of the match |
| `game_id` | `String` | Must match the `game_id` stored in the match |
| `winner` | `Winner` | The outcome: `Player1`, `Player2`, or `Draw` |
| `caller` | `Address` | Must be the registered oracle address; must authorize this call |

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `ContractPaused` | Contract is currently paused |
| `Unauthorized` | `caller` is not the registered oracle |
| `MatchNotFound` | No match exists for `match_id` |
| `GameIdMismatch` | `game_id` does not match the match's stored `game_id` |
| `InvalidState` | Match is not in `Active` state |
| `NotFunded` | One or both players have not deposited (should not occur if state is `Active`) |

**Payout Logic**

| Winner | Payout |
|--------|--------|
| `Player1` | Player1 receives `stake_amount × 2` |
| `Player2` | Player2 receives `stake_amount × 2` |
| `Draw` | Each player receives their `stake_amount` back |

**Events**

Emits `("match", "completed")` with data `(match_id, winner)`.

**Example**

```rust
// Oracle submits result
client.submit_result(
    &match_id,
    &String::from_str(&env, "lichess-game-abc123"),
    &Winner::Player1,
    &oracle_address,
);
```

---

### `cancel_match`

Cancels a `Pending` match and refunds any deposits already made. Either player can cancel.

```rust
pub fn cancel_match(env: Env, match_id: u64, caller: Address) -> Result<(), Error>
```

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success.

**Errors**

| Error | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `MatchNotFound` | No match exists for `match_id` |
| `InvalidState` | Match is not in `Pending` state (cannot cancel `Active` or `Completed` matches) |
| `Unauthorized` | `caller` is neither `player1` nor `player2` |

**Refund Logic**

Only deposits that have been made are refunded. If only one player deposited before cancellation, only that player is refunded.

**Events**

Emits `("match", "cancelled")` with data `match_id`.

**Example**

```rust
// Player1 deposited but wants to cancel before player2 deposits
client.deposit(&match_id, &player1);
client.cancel_match(&match_id, &player1);
// player1 is refunded their stake_amount
```

---

### `get_match`

if client.is_funded(&match_id) {
    // Both players have deposited; match is Active
}
```

---

### `get_escrow_balance`

Returns the total token balance currently held in escrow for a match.

```rust
pub fn get_escrow_balance(env: Env, match_id: u64) -> Result<i128, Error>
```

## Match Lifecycle

```
create_match()
      │
      ▼
  [Pending] ──── cancel_match() ──► [Cancelled]
      │
  deposit() × 2
      │
      ▼
  [Active]
      │
  submit_result()
      │
      ▼
  [Completed]
```

- A match in `Active` or `Completed` state **cannot** be cancelled.
- A match in `Pending` state **cannot** have a result submitted.
- Deposits are only accepted in `Pending` state.

## Testing

### Running Tests Locally

This contract includes comprehensive unit tests and property-based fuzz tests using [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/1.0.0/proptest/). All tests can be run locally with standard Rust tooling.

#### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.88.0 or later
- Soroban SDK and targets installed:
  ```bash
  rustup install 1.88.0
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

#### Run All Tests

```bash
cargo test -p smile4money-escrow --lib
```

#### Run Only Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test -p smile4money-escrow --lib tests:: -- --skip tests_fuzz
```

#### Run Only Fuzz Tests

```bash
cargo test -p smile4money-escrow --lib tests_fuzz
```

#### Run Property-Based Tests with Increased Iterations

By default, proptest runs 256 iterations per test. To increase coverage (useful for finding rare edge cases), set the `PROPTEST_CASES` environment variable:

```bash
PROPTEST_CASES=1000 cargo test -p smile4money-escrow --lib tests_fuzz::prop_
```

#### Run Exhaustive Fuzz Tests Only

The exhaustive fuzz tests exercise exact boundary conditions and known-bad inputs:

```bash
cargo test -p smile4money-escrow --lib tests_fuzz::fuzz_
```

### Fuzz Test Coverage

The fuzz test suite (`src/tests_fuzz.rs`) covers:

#### Stake Amount Validation

- **Valid range**: Tests that amounts in `[MIN_STAKE, MAX_STAKE]` are accepted
- **Below minimum**: Tests that stakes < `MIN_STAKE` are rejected with `StakeTooLow`
- **Above maximum**: Tests that stakes > `MAX_STAKE` are rejected with `StakeTooHigh`
- **Boundaries**: Exact tests for `MIN_STAKE`, `MIN_STAKE-1`, `MAX_STAKE`, `MAX_STAKE+1`, zero, and negative values

#### Game ID Validation

- **Valid IDs**: Tests accept alphanumeric strings, underscores, and hyphens in the range `[1, 64]` bytes
- **Empty strings**: Tests reject empty game IDs with `InvalidGameId`
- **Oversized IDs**: Tests reject game IDs > 64 bytes with `InvalidGameId`
- **Invalid characters**: Tests reject game IDs containing `@`, `#`, `.`, `/`, spaces, null bytes, and other non-alphanumeric characters with `InvalidGameId`
- **Length boundaries**: Exact tests for IDs at `MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`, one over, and one under

#### Address Validation

- **Identical players**: Tests reject `player1 == player2` with `InvalidPlayers`
- **Distinct players**: Tests accept two different valid addresses
- **Zero address**: Implementation already handles zero addresses (XDR-based check in `is_zero_address`)

### CI Integration

All fuzz tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline:

1. **Escrow Fuzz Tests Job** — runs in GitHub Actions on every push to `master` and on all pull requests
   - Property-based tests: 100 iterations per test via `PROPTEST_CASES=100`
   - Exhaustive fuzz tests: All boundary and character validation tests

To view CI test results:

```bash
# Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/obajecollinsmicheal-cmd/smile4money/actions
```

## Security Notes

- **Oracle authorization**: Only the registered oracle address can submit results. The `game_id` must match the one stored at match creation to prevent cross-match result injection.
- **Duplicate game IDs**: Each `game_id` can only be used in one match. Attempting to reuse a `game_id` returns `DuplicateGameId`.
- **Self-match prevention**: `player1` and `player2` must be different addresses.
- **Pause mechanism**: The admin can pause the contract to block `create_match`, `deposit`, and `submit_result` in an emergency. `cancel_match` and read functions remain available while paused.
- **TTL management**: Match storage is extended to ~30 days (518,400 ledgers) on every state-changing operation to prevent premature expiry.
- **Admin-only operations**: `pause`, `unpause`, and `update_oracle` require admin authorization. Non-admin callers receive `Unauthorized`.
