//! Policy constants for the tournament bracket contract.

//! The ledger durations and identifier limits come from
//! [`smile4money_common::constants`] so this contract cannot drift away from the
//! escrow and oracle contracts. `lib.rs` does `pub use constants::*`, which keeps
//! `crate::MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS` resolvable from the unit tests.
