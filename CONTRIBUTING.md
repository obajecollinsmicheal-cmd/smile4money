# Contributing to smile4money

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document covers environment setup, running tests, and PR guidelines.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.88.0 (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`) — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
  ```bash
  # Install rustup (if not already installed)
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  
  # The project's rust-toolchain.toml will automatically install Rust 1.88.0
  # and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target when you first run cargo commands
  ```
- **wasm32 target** (required for Soroban contracts): `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - **Note**: This target is automatically installed when you build if `rust-toolchain.toml` is present
- **Stellar CLI** — [install guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli)
- **Git**

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obajecollinsmicheal-cmd/smile4money.git
cd smile4money
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your testnet credentials
```

## Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
# or
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Test

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
# or
cargo test
```

Run formatters and lints before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

cd apps/frontend
npm ci
npm run format
npm run format:check

cd ../backend
npm ci
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

## Branch Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-<N>-short-description` | `fix/issue-1-double-initialize` |
| New test | `test/issue-<N>-short-description` | `test/issue-22-cancel-partial-refund` |
| Documentation | `docs/issue-<N>-short-description` | `docs/issue-220-contributing-guide` |
| Feature | `feat/issue-<N>-short-description` | `feat/issue-17-update-oracle` |
| Refactor | `refactor/issue-<N>-short-description` | `refactor/issue-221-workspace-deps` |

Always branch off `master`:

```bash
git checkout master && git pull
git checkout -b fix/issue-<N>-short-description
```

## Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <short summary (≤72 chars)>
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`.

Examples:
```
fix: guard initialize against double-call
test: cancel_match refunds only player1 when only player1 deposited
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md with dev setup and PR guidelines
refactor: move shared deps to workspace-level Cargo.toml
```

## Code Review Process

### Approval Requirements

- **Minimum approvals required**: 1 approval from a repository maintainer
- **Who can approve**: Repository maintainers with write access
- **When approval is required**: All PRs must be approved before they can be merged to `master`

### Review SLA (Service Level Agreement)

We aim to maintain responsive code review:

- **Initial review response**: Within 3 business days of PR submission
- **Subsequent responses**: Within 2 business days of new activity (e.g., updates, replies to comments)
- **Priority PRs** (documentation, critical fixes, small changes): May receive faster reviews

If a PR does not receive a review within the SLA, you can:
- Mention a reviewer with `@reviewer-name`
- Post a message in the team communication channel
- Contact the maintainers directly

### Review Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate PRs based on:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follows project code style and conventions
   - No unnecessary complexity or duplication
   - Proper error handling and edge cases
   - Clear, maintainable logic

2. **Testing**
   - All new behaviour is covered by tests
   - Tests are meaningful and comprehensive
   - Existing tests still pass

3. **Documentation**
   - Code changes are documented where appropriate
   - Complex logic includes comments
   - Breaking changes are noted in the PR description

4. **Security & Performance**
   - No security vulnerabilities introduced
   - No performance regressions
   - Secrets and sensitive data are not committed

5. **Commit Quality**
   - Follows Conventional Commits format
   - Commits are logically organized
   - Commit messages are clear and descriptive

### Merge Requirements

A PR can only be merged when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **At least 1 approval** from a repository maintainer
2. **All CI checks pass**:
   - Escrow unit & doc tests (`Escrow Tests`)
   - Oracle unit & doc tests (`Oracle Tests`)
   - Code coverage ≥ 80% (`Coverage`)
   - Clippy with zero warnings (`Clippy`)
   - Rust formatting (`Format`)
   - Prettier frontend formatting (`Prettier`)
   - WASM build succeeds (`Build`)
   - environments.toml is valid (`Validate environments.toml`)
   - Frontend type-check, lint, and tests pass (`Frontend`)
3. **No unresolved comments** from reviewers
4. **Branch is up to date** with `master`
5. **A changelog entry is present** (if the change affects users or introduces breaking changes)
   - For documentation-only or internal refactoring: changelog entry may be optional
   - Include a brief description of the change in the appropriate section

### The Review & Merge Process

1. **Submit your PR** with a clear title and description linking to issue(s) using `Closes #<N>`
2. **Address feedback** by pushing new commits to your branch (do not rewrite history)
3. **Request re-review** after addressing all comments by clicking "Re-request review"
4. **Once approved**, a maintainer will merge using **squash merge** to keep history linear
5. **Ensure your branch is up to date** — GitHub will prevent merging if your branch is behind `master`

### What to Expect if Changes Are Requested

- Feedback is constructive and collaborative, not critical
- You will have adequate time to address feedback (typically 1 week for non-critical comments)
- If consensus is unclear, you can ask for clarification or escalate to other maintainers
- Minor suggestions are often marked as `nit:` for optional improvements

## CI Security: Action Pinning

All third-party GitHub Actions used in `.github/workflows/*.yml` **must** be pinned to their full immutable commit SHA, not to a version tag. This prevents supply-chain attacks where a tag is silently moved to a malicious commit.

```
# ✅ Correct — pinned by SHA with a version comment
- uses: actions/checkout@34e114876b0b11c390a56381ad16ebd13914f8d5 # v4

# ❌ Incorrect — mutable tag reference
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

When adding or updating an action:

1. Resolve the SHA by querying the upstream repository.
2. Use the full 40-character SHA after `@`.
3. Append the original version as a trailing comment (e.g. `# v4`).

To resolve the SHA for a tagged action:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git refs/tags/<tag>
```

## Branch Protection Rules

The `master` branch is protected. The following rules are enforced for all pull requests:

### Required Status Checks

All of the jobs below must pass before a PR can be merged:

| Check | Job name in CI |
|-------|---------------|
| Escrow unit & doc tests | `Escrow Tests` |
| Oracle unit & doc tests | `Oracle Tests` |
| Code coverage ≥ 80 % | `Coverage` |
| Clippy (zero warnings) | `Clippy` |
| Rust formatting | `Format` |
| Prettier (frontend) | `Prettier` |
| WASM build | `Build` |
| environments.toml valid | `Validate environments.toml` |
| Frontend type-check / lint / tests | `Frontend` |
| Backend build (type-check) / tests | `Backend` |

### Required Reviewers

At least **1 approving review** from a repository maintainer is required before merge.

### Merge Policy

- Only **squash merges** are allowed — this keeps the commit history linear and readable.
- Direct pushes to `master` are **blocked** for all contributors, including maintainers.
- Branches must be **up to date** with `master` before merging.

### Setting Up Branch Protection on a Fork

If you are working on a personal fork, you can replicate these rules by following the
[GitHub branch protection documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:
- A clear title prefixed with the category (`Fix:`, `Test:`, `Docs:`, `Feat:`)
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behaviour

For security vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
