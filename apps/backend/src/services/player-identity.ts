/**
 * Player Identity Verification Service
 *
 * This service verifies that the players reported by the chess platform APIs
 * (Lichess or Chess.com) correspond to the Stellar addresses registered in
 * the on-chain match record.
 *
 * Security Model:
 * ───────────────
 * When a match is created, the off-chain oracle records the mapping between:
 *   - Stellar addresses (player1, player2)
 *   - Chess platform usernames (e.g., alice, bob on Lichess)
 *
 * When the oracle later fetches and submits a game result, it verifies:
 *   1. The game exists on the platform
 *   2. The two players in the game match the registered mapping
 *   3. The result is submitted to the correct match_id
 *
 * This prevents a malicious actor from "swapping" results between matches or
 * injecting game results where the oracle never verified player identities.
 *
 * Example Attack Scenario (Without Verification):
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Admin creates match: (player1=Alice, player2=Bob) for game ABC123
 * 2. Malicious oracle submits result of DIFFERENT game XYZ789 where:
 *    - White: Charlie, Black: David
 *    - Result: Charlie wins
 * 3. Escrow contract pays Alice (player1) because the result says "Player1Wins"
 * 4. But Charlie and David played game XYZ789, not Alice and Bob!
 *
 * Defense:
 * ─────────
 * Before accepting the result, the oracle verifies:
 *   - Game ABC123 players: white=alice, black=bob ✓ matches player1/player2
 *   - Result: alice wins → payout to Alice (player1) ✓ correct
 *
 * Injected game XYZ789 would be rejected because charlie/david don't match
 * the registered players.

 *
 * - `{ valid: true }` if players match
 * - `{ valid: false, error: "..." }` if verification fails
 *
 * # Verification Logic
 *
 * The function checks if the reported players (by username) correspond to the
 * registered Stellar addresses:
 *
 * 1. **Exact Match**: Both usernames match in order
 *    - API: white=alice, black=bob
 *    - Registered: player1=alice, player2=bob
 *    - Result: ✓ Valid
 *
 * 2. **Swapped Players**: Usernames match but in reverse order
 *    - API: white=bob, black=alice
 *    - Registered: player1=alice, player2=bob
 *    - Result: ✓ Valid (but result will be flipped: player2 wins instead of player1)
 *
 * 3. **Missing Player**: Username not found or doesn't match
 *    - API: white=alice, black=charlie
 *    - Registered: player1=alice, player2=bob
 *    - Result: ✗ Invalid (charlie ≠ bob)
 *
 * 4. **Injected Game**: Completely different players
 *    - API: white=charlie, black=david
 *    - Registered: player1=alice, player2=bob
 *    - Result: ✗ Invalid (charlie ≠ alice, david ≠ bob)
 *
 * # Case Sensitivity
 *
 * Usernames are compared case-insensitively after trimming whitespace,
 * as chess platform usernames are typically case-insensitive.

/**
 * Identity Hash Binding (#1720)
 * ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `verifyPlayerIdentities` above checks usernames reported by the chess
 * platform API against the usernames captured in the match record — but
 * that captured record itself was never cryptographically bound to the
 * match. Nothing stopped the stored `player1Username`/`player2Username`
 * fields from being altered after creation (a storage bug, a future code
 * path, direct DB access) and `verifyPlayerIdentities` would happily verify
 * against the *new* value, having no way to tell it had changed.
 *
 * `computeIdentityHash` produces a single SHA-256 digest over all four
 * identity-defining fields (both players' platform usernames and Stellar
 * addresses) at match-creation time. `MatchStore`/`SqliteMatchStore` persist
 * it alongside the record as `identityHash`. Before accepting a result,
 * `verifyIdentityHash` recomputes the digest from the match record's
 * *current* fields and compares it to the stored one — any divergence means
 * the identity binding captured at creation no longer matches what is on
 * record, and the result is rejected rather than silently verified against
 * whatever the fields now say.
 *
 * Hashing (rather than storing the fields a second time) means the stored
 * fields and the hash can be compared without a separate "trusted copy" to
 * keep in sync, and the digest is cheap to carry in signed match metadata or
 * on-chain if the binding later needs to move there.
 */

 * `verifyPlayerIdentities` normalizes usernames (trimmed, lowercased) so the

 * between the value captured at creation and any later re-read of it.
 * Stellar addresses are uppercased (their canonical StrKey form) rather than
 * lowercased, so a hash computed here always matches one computed from a
 * canonically-formatted address regardless of input casing.

 * 3. verifyPlayerIdentities() already handles color-agnostic verification
