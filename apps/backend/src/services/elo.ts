/**
 * Lichess ELO rating lookup for stake pricing.
 *
 * Lichess exposes a public per-user rating endpoint that needs no OAuth scope
 * beyond the standard token this service already sends for game lookups:
 *
 * ```text
 * GET https://lichess.org/api/user/{username}
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why the rating is resolved at match creation
 *
 * The multiplier is a function of both players' ratings *at the moment the
 * match is created*. Fetching later — say, when the result comes in — would
 * let a rating change between stake and payout, so the multiplier the winner was
 * promised would no longer be the one the formula produces. Reading both
 * ratings once, at creation, and storing them alongside the multiplier makes
 * the price a function of committed inputs.
 *
 * ## Failure is non-fatal by design
 *
 * A rating lookup is a *pricing input*, not a correctness input. If Lichess is
 * down, rate-limits us, or the username is unknown, the match must still be
 * creatable at the base stake. Every failure path here resolves to `null`
 * rather than throwing, and the caller turns that into multiplier 1 via
 * `resolveMultiplier`. See `elo-multiplier.ts` for why the fallback is the
 * conservative direction.
 *
 * Rate limiting goes through the shared Lichess limiter, so rating lookups
 * compete for the same budget as game polls rather than multiplying the
 * request rate against Lichess' published limits.
