## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Smart Contract — Escrow
- `safe_address` parameter in `initialize`: immutable destination for `emergency_drain`, preventing a compromised admin from draining funds to an arbitrary address (#86)
- Configurable `dispute_window_ledgers` and `timeout_ledgers` in `initialize`: optional parameters that override the contract defaults (~24 hours and ~7 days respectively), enabling per-deployment tuning for testnet, mainnet, or high-stakes contexts (#86)
- `list_matches_after(after_match_id, limit)` cursor-based pagination: replaces offset pagination with a stable, sparse-ID-safe cursor approach; an empty result unambiguously signals end-of-data (#86)
- `ESCROW_RESERVE_BUFFER_STROOPS` guard (15 000 000 stroops = 1.5 XLM): every payout now checks that the contract retains at least this balance post-transfer, preventing `transfer` failures that would leave match state inconsistent (#86)
- `half_fun` first-deposit event `("match", "half_fun")`: emitted exactly once when the first of two players deposits, carrying `(match_id, player_label, stake_amount)` for off-chain observability (#86)
- `PendingResult` match state for dispute window support (#TBD)
- `claim_timeout` configuration for dispute window duration (#TBD)
- `override_result` admin function to correct fraudulent oracle submissions during dispute window (#TBD)
- `claim_payout` function for winners to claim funds after dispute window expires (#TBD)
- Stake amount limits (minimum and maximum) validation (#TBD)

#### Documentation
- Document `environments.toml` fields in `README.md` with descriptions and defaults (#115)
- Prerequisites section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` now specifies Rust 1.88.0 from `rust-toolchain.toml` (#1114)
- Oracle key compromise response runbook entry in `docs/runbook.md` (#1115)

### Changed
- Match state machine now includes `PendingResult` intermediate state between `Active` and `Completed`
- Winner payouts require explicit `claim_payout` call after dispute window expires
- `submit_result` transitions matches to `PendingResult` instead of immediately completing

### Fixed

#### Smart Contract
- Prevent double initialization of escrow contract (re-initialization guard) (#1)
- Prevent double initialization of oracle contract (#2)
- Use `try_transfer` for refunds instead of `transfer` to surface errors cleanly
- Verify token transfer in `deposit` before updating state
- Remove duplicate `Display` impls conflicting with `#[contracterror]` macro (E0428)
- Remove broken intra-doc link to non-existent `Error::InvalidToken`
- Resolve compile errors in escrow `lib.rs`
- Resolve Clippy errors, redundant clones, and dead code
- Resolve rustfmt failures (trailing whitespace)
- Resolve test assertion bugs in e2e tests
- Resolve infrastructure compile errors and test mismatches (#118)
- Fix CI/CD branch triggers from `main`/`develop` to `master` (#117)

#### Frontend
- Wire `handleClaim` and `handleBurn` to actual Stellar SDK transaction submission
- Wire `disconnect`, `refreshBalance`, `balance`, and `wrongNetwork` in `App.tsx`
- Fix CSS import path and add missing wallet-info layout styles
- Fix confirm overlay display (inline block instead of fixed full-screen modal)
- Add `wrongNetwork` to `WalletStatus` type
- Fix PostCSS config ESM conflict and unblock claim-burn tests
- Resolve multiple wallet state typing and wiring inconsistencies

#### CI
- Resolve all Clippy, Format, and Test CI failures (multiple rounds)
- Bump toolchain to satisfy `darling`/`serde_with` dependency requirements
- Apply `cargo-audit` 0.22.0 migration

### Security
- Document full threat model covering oracle key compromise and admin key loss (#119)
- Add `pause` + `drain` emergency function for critical exploit recovery (#912)
- Add re-initialization guards to both escrow and oracle contracts
- Validate token address in `initialize` to prevent rogue token injection
- Enforce game ID uniqueness to prevent duplicate-match payout exploits
- Add `game_id` cross-match injection guard (`Error::GameIdMismatch`)
- Document integer overflow risk in `submit_result` payout calculation
- Document re-entrancy analysis confirming Soroban execution model prevents re-entrancy

### Changed
- `submit_result` now requires a `game_id` parameter that must match the stored match record
- Oracle contract now emits `("oracle", "init")` event on initialization
- Oracle contract validates `game_id` length (1–64 bytes) on submission
- `cancel_match` with both players deposited requires authorization from both parties
- Replace `panic!` in Oracle `initialize` with proper `Error::AlreadyInitialized`
